# Django-CDN
Content Delivery Network on virtual machines using Django as frontend
This was developed as a part of project CDN in which user will develop his virtual machines using a frontend and details will be saves in MySQL database. Then on backend these details will be used to create virtual machines on which pre-designed image will be installed on its initialization. One of these machines would have a django running on them as webserver to upload, manage and view content.

Webserver is running of a virtual machine but the storage is on someother machine. So the interface takes the video and stores it on another virtual machine if the required capacity is available of that server
