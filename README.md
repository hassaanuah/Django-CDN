# Django-CDN
Content Delivery Network on virtual machines using Django as frontend
This was developed as a part of project CDN in which user will develop his virtual machines using a frontend and details will be saves in MySQL database. Then on backend these details will be used to create virtual machines on which pre-designed image will be installed on its initialization. One of these machines would have a django running on them as webserver to upload, manage and view content.
